This document provides guidance for troubleshooting common issues with the voice/video API.

## Common Issues

### Failed to connect to call

- **Check API keys:** Ensure that the API keys for the configured providers are correct.
- **Check network connection:** Verify that you have a stable network connection.
- **Check browser permissions:** Make sure that your browser has permission to access your microphone and camera.

### Poor call quality

- **Check network connection:** A weak or unstable network connection is the most common cause of poor call quality.
- **Check system resources:** High CPU or memory usage can also affect call quality.
- **Try a different provider:** If you are consistently experiencing poor quality with one provider, try switching to another.
